# Otto Phase 0 Test Suite

This test suite provides comprehensive coverage of the Otto Phase 0 foundation components, following a Red-Green-Refactor approach where tests are written first to drive implementation.

## Test Structure

### Phase 1: Foundation Tests
These tests establish the basic infrastructure components that everything else builds upon.

#### Tool System (`test/otto/tool_test.exs`, `test/otto/tool_bus_test.exs`)
- **Tool Behaviour**: Defines the contract that all tools must implement
  - `name/0`: Returns unique tool identifier
  - `permissions/0`: Returns required permissions (`:read`, `:write`, `:exec`)
  - `call/2`: Executes tool with parameters and context
- **ToolBus Registry**: Central registry for tool discovery and execution
  - Tool registration with hot-reload support
  - Permission checking at invocation time
  - Concurrent access handling
  - Error isolation (tool crashes don't affect other tools)

#### Supervision Tree (`test/otto/supervision_test.exs`)
- **Application Startup**: Verifies all required children start correctly
  - Otto.ToolBus (tool registry)
  - Otto.Agent.Registry (agent process lookup)
  - Otto.Agent.DynamicSupervisor (agent lifecycle management)
  - Otto.ContextStore (agent context storage)
  - Otto.Checkpointer (artifact persistence)
  - Otto.CostTracker (usage and budget tracking)
- **Failure Recovery**: Components restart correctly when crashed
- **Process Isolation**: One component failure doesn't cascade

#### Storage Components (`test/otto/context_store_test.exs`, `test/otto/checkpointer_test.exs`, `test/otto/cost_tracker_test.exs`)
- **ContextStore**: ETS-based per-agent context storage
  - Bounded size with LRU eviction
  - Concurrent read/write access
  - Automatic cleanup on agent termination
- **Checkpointer**: Filesystem-based artifact persistence
  - Atomic writes with temp file + rename
  - Session-based directory structure
  - Retention policy and cleanup
  - Artifact metadata (size, checksum, timestamps)
- **CostTracker**: Token usage and cost calculation
  - Per-model pricing configuration
  - Usage aggregation by scope (agent, workflow, session)
  - Budget warnings and enforcement
  - Historical usage tracking

### Phase 2: Core Component Tests
These tests cover the main agent functionality and configuration management.

#### Agent Configuration (`test/otto/agent_config_test.exs`)
- **YAML Loading**: Parse agent configurations from files
  - Environment variable interpolation (`${VAR:-default}`)
  - Validation of required fields
  - Tool reference validation

  - `test/fixtures/agents/valid_basic.yml`
  - `test/fixtures/agents/valid_complex.yml`
  - `test/fixtures/agents/invalid_*.yml`

#### Agent Server (`test/otto/agent_server_test.exs`)
- **Lifecycle Management**: Agent startup, state management, shutdown
  - Unique session ID generation
  - Working directory creation and cleanup
  - Budget tracking initialization

- **Transcript Management**: Bounded conversation history
  - Message ordering preservation
  - Automatic size limits
- **Budget Enforcement**: Time, token, and cost limits
  - Real-time countdown tracking

#### Tool Implementations (`test/otto/tools/fs_read_test.exs`)
- **Filesystem Tools**: File operations with sandboxing
  - Path traversal prevention
  - Working directory enforcement
  - Permission checking
  - Size limit enforcement
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure handling
  - File not found errors
  - Permission denied errors
  - Invalid parameter handling
- **ToolBus Integration**: Tools work through the registry
  - Registration and lookup
  - Permission-based invocation
  - Error isolation

### Phase 3: Integration Tests
These tests verify end-to-end workflows and system behavior under stress.

#### End-to-End Workflows (`test/otto/integration_test.exs`)
- **Complete Agent Lifecycle**: YAML → agent start → tool execution → cleanup
  - Configuration loading from YAML
  - Agent registration in dynamic supervisor

- **Performance Targets**: Startup time < 500ms per agent

#### Budget Enforcement (`test/otto/budget_enforcement_test.exs`)
- **Time Budget**: Real-time countdown and enforcement
  - Background timer process
  - Invocation blocking when exceeded
  - Warning logs at threshold

  - Invalid responses
  - Timeout handling
- **Agent Server Recovery**: Process isolation and restart

## Next Steps for Implementation

The test suite is complete and provides a comprehensive specification for Otto Phase 0. Implementation should follow these tests to ensure all requirements are met:

1. **Start with failing tests**: Run the test suite to see what needs to be implemented
2. **Implement incrementally**: Work through Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3
3. **Follow the interfaces**: Tests define the exact API contracts expected
4. **Maintain test coverage**: Keep tests passing as implementation evolves
5. **Use tests for regression protection**: Ensure new features don't break existing ones

The test suite serves as both specification and validation for the Otto Phase 0 foundation, ensuring a robust and reliable agent runtime system.
